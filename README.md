#A Wonderful Life Photography Page

I have made a website that tells the visitor a little about myself, the business and my work. It is easy to follow and is easy on the eyes as well. I hope to see that people enjoy my website and would be interested in contacting me for work or for my own photos to print. I have essentially taken a basic site and made it my own with my photos and a link to my personal camera at the bottom of the page. I have decided on some cooler colors to ease the eyes and make everything easier to look at.

##UX

I tried to design this website for anyone looking for some photos or to get in touch with me about a photogrpahy job. I was hoping to achieve a site that is easy to navigate but will also catch your eye and I feel like I've done that through the use of my color choices, as well as using my own photos as a background to the pages. I would like my website to serve as a place that people can look at my photos and possibly book a session. I generally introduce myself and where I am from to give an idea to people where I live and how close they are to me.

##User stories

As a new visitor to the website, I can easily find my way around the website to find what I need.

As a person exploring for new photographers, I can look at his work in the gallery page and contact him for more or for a photo.

As a person looking to make an appointment, I can look to see where he will be and when and contact him to arrange a meeting.

As another photographer, I can look to see where he is from and see if he is close to me to see if we can arrange a collaboration.
