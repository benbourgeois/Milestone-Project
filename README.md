# A Wonderful Life Photography Page

I have made a website that tells the visitor a little about myself, the business and my work. It is easy to follow and is easy on the eyes as well. I hope to see that people enjoy my website and would be interested in contacting me for work or for my own photos to print. I have essentially taken a basic site and made it my own with my photos and a link to my personal camera at the bottom of the page. I have decided on some cooler colors to ease the eyes and make everything easier to look at. I hope to achieve the feat of making a name for myself by using my photogrpahy. 

## UX

I tried to design this website for anyone looking for some photos or to get in touch with me about a photogrpahy job. I was hoping to achieve a site that is easy to navigate but will also catch your eye and I feel like I've done that through the use of my color choices, as well as using my own photos as a background to the pages. I would like my website to serve as a place that people can look at my photos and possibly book a session. I generally introduce myself and where I am from to give an idea to people where I live and how close they are to me.

## User stories
